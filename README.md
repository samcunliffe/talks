Talks
=====

I don't give talks as often as I used to, but here's a list of recent ones.
[Tutorials](./tutorials.md) are listed elsewhere.

Most of my talks are CC-by-4.0 but some aren't. And the logos of my employers are obviously under different usage rules.

2022-04-05 Test-driven development (in python).
2019-02-13 High-level analysis software for the Belle II experiment.
